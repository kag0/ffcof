		<h3>Essentials4Home</h3><br>
		<p>
			During 2019, FFCOF assisted in establishing or supporting indigent residents in San Diego and Imperial Counties by
			providing household and living essentials. Projects and organizations we worked with included:
		</p>
		<div class="col-xl-4 col-lg-6 col-sm-12 program">
			<h5>New Move-Ins</h5>
			<p>
				Poor and disabled clients are referred to FFCOF through ongoing coordination with Catholic Charities’ programs and
				organizations including Rapid Re-Housing, (San Diego and El Centro), Leah’s Residence (San Diego), House of Hope (El
				Centro). These programs operate through the common entry system to identify and move people from homeless shelters
				or at
				risk situations,
				such as domestic violence, into long term apartments. FCO in turn, contacts the persons in need, identify essentials
				to
				establish their household, and take them shopping to help honor their dignity. Lessons in budgeting and making wise
				purchasing decisions are part of the multi-hour shopping engagement. Items purchased include essentials for:
				cleaning,
				laundry, kitchen, cooking, dishes, microwave, mini-refrigerator, shelving, beds, bedding, and sometimes furniture
				and
				essential clothing. The Foundation served 11 adults and 15 kids.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-xl-4 col-lg-6 col-sm-12 program">
			<h5>Needs of students’ families</h5>
			<p>
				are identified in ongoing coordination with administration, and staff are tasked with assisting in identifying and
				meeting these objectives (schools currently are in San Diego County). In 2019, FFCOF assisted with uniforms, bus
				passes
				and laptop insurance at e3 Civic High School, San Diego. These indigents can remain FCO clients as long as they seek
				our
				assistance, particularly with providing for childrens’ needs to attend school. These same families are phoned
				monthly to
				invite them to come to the school for a food pantry. Tutoring and a
				parenting class are also offered by the school during pantry hours. The Foundation engaged approximately 15 indigent
				families.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-xl-4 col-lg-6 col-sm-12 program">
			<h5>Holiday Outreach for Leah’s Residence for
			disabled or handicapped homeless to establish residency</h5>
			<p>
				FFCOF provided stockings filled with essentials, e.g. hand towels, fruit, Vitamin C drops, socks, etc. FFCOF also
				obtained donations of women's clothing wrapped and labeled by size and toys, selected according to each child’s age and
				gender and helped wrap, and delivered December 18th for their Christmas party December 19th. The Foundation provided for
				27 adults and 4 children.

		<h3>Essentials4Homeless/Sheltered</h3>

			homeless indigents we supported at the time these projects took place, resided at the below shelters operated by
			Catholic Charities:
		</p>
		<div class="col-xl-4 col-lg-6 col-sm-12 program">
			<h5>Annual Holiday Outreach for La Posada de Guadalupe Men’s Interim Housing</h5>
			<p>
				FFCOF purchased size specific sweatshirts for these indigent men. FFCOF volunteers marked the sweatshirts by size by
				tieing with beautiful coordinating ribbon. Donated hardcover novels were wrapped and handed out to the men as we called
				them by name and gave them their sweatshirt. Gifts were presented to the men at the Annual Christmas Party we put on for
				them, December 15th, with a Ham Dinner donated by the neighboring community, St. Therese of Carmel parishioners and
				FFCOF. The volunteer guitarist and singers were a well appreciated addition to all of us singing carols WITH the men.
				The men are always very grateful for the icebreaker game, noisemakers, homemade Christmas cards with hand written
				letters of hope inside and gift wrapped homemade cookies. FFCOF also participates in providing, cooking, serving and
				eating monthly dinners with the men at La Posada. The Foundation 94 indigent individuals.

				Items included socks, underwear, toiletries, clothing and jackets. These items were gift wrapped for each family
				member,

			<p>
				Christmas cards with a hand written letter of hope inside were offered to guests at the Christmas Party we put on
				for
				them, December 12th with a volunteer pianist to accompany us volunteers singing carols WITH the
				women. The women always are very grateful for the noisemakers, homemade Christmas cards with Letters of Hope inside
				and
				gift wrapped homemade cookies. Volunteers serve lunch at Rachel’s Day Shelter twice per mo. The Foundation engaged
				approximately 50 indigent women.

			<h5>Leah’s Lunch Classes</h5>
			<p>
				In 2019, FFCOF volunteers started offering monthly educational interactive classes for Leah’s Residence,
				residential
				apartments for handicapped, disabled, low income, and homeless individuals and families. The classes support
				healthy
				life choices and wellbeing. Lunch is also incorporated into the learning process with guidelines on how to read
				food
				labels, nutrition to improve health, proper food handling, efficient food prep, and hands on food preparation. The
				total
				people present at the five classes were approximately 60 individuals.

			<h5>School Supplies</h5>
			<p>
				The Foundation supported indigent students with backpacks and school supplies at e3 Civic High (San Diego), Our Lady's
				School (OLS, San Diego), Leah’s Residence Apts. (San Diego), and Lilac Elementary (Valley Center). FFCOF worked with
				administration to get specific school supply lists for each grade or student, including favorite colors in some cases.
				The community was invited to the Workshop August 3rd, where the items were sorted and assembled by school and grade.
				Volunteers hand-decorated labels with the student's name and/or school and attached with sparkling ribbon. An age
				appropriate Note of Encouragement was put inside with granola bars. We enjoyed meeting some of the students as we handed
				out the backpacks at OLS two campuses at Back to School Nights and at e3 Civic
				High. The Foundation engaged 150 indigent students.

			<h5>O’Farrell Charter School Garden</h5>
			<p>
				FFCOF created an outreach project for e3 Civic High School’s “Outreach Day” where all approximately 400 students
				volunteer for outreach instead of attending classes for the day… FFCOF identified O'Farrell Charter school serving 1,800
				students (San Diego Unified School District) as a recipient for the outreach project. Serving students from
				pre-kindergarten through 12th grade, O'Farrell's total minority enrollment is 98%, and 71% of all students are
				economically disadvantaged. In coordination with administration and staff, the need for work in the garden was
				identified. More than 20 students from e3 Civic High came for their Outreach Day and assisted
				O’Farrell students as teachers brought their classes to the garden to work at learning stations that FFCOF created,
				including composting, building trellises, planting, and garden art. This project engaged approximately 75 individuals.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-xl-4 col-lg-6 col-sm-12 program">
			<h5>O’Farrell Charter School Mural</h5>
			<p>
				In continued coordination with O’Farrell school administration, FFCOF offered to assist with a community project. In
				partnering with Art Reach of San Diego, (a non-profit art organization) FFCOF volunteers assisted in planning and
				obtaining donations of supplies for painting a 10ft x 10ft mural of wings to lift student spirits and encourage students
				to strive to reach their potential. The work occurred with the involvement of
				teachers, ART Reach representatives and four O'Farrell 7th grade students who won a competition of designing the wings.
				This project engaged approximately 75 individuals.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-xl-4 col-lg-6 col-sm-12 program">
			<h5>Food Distribution at e3 Civic High School</h5>
			<p>
				Starting in September, FFCOF volunteers handed out food monthly to indigent students’ families at e3 Civic High
				School.
				This need is identified in ongoing coordination with administration. Staff are tasked with assisting in identifying
				and
				meeting families’ needs. (In 2019, FFCOF was accepted as a San Diego Food Bank Non-Profit Partner.) The Foundation
				served 15 indigent families totaling approximately 60 monthly sized portions of food for families of 3-7 people.
